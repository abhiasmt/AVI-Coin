# AVI Coin

## Project Description
AVI Coin is a decentralized wallet smart contract deployed on the Ethereum blockchain, allowing users to securely deposit, withdraw, and check their Ether balances in a trustless, self-custody environment. The project demonstrates essential wallet functionalities while leveraging Solidity for secure on-chain value management.

## Project Vision
To empower users with seamless, secure control over their cryptocurrency funds through a simple yet effective decentralized wallet, promoting transparency and autonomy without reliance on centralized intermediaries.

## Key Features
- **Deposit Ether:** Users can send Ether to the wallet to securely store value on-chain.
- **Withdraw Ether:** Users can withdraw their own Ether balance at any time.
- **Balance Inquiry:** Users can check their individual wallet balances transparently.

## Future Scope
- Adding support for ERC20 and NFT token management within the wallet.
- Incorporating multisignature functionalities to enhance security.
- Developing frontend interfaces such as web or mobile apps for improved user experience.
- Implementing wallet recovery and access control mechanisms.
- Enabling interaction with DeFi protocols directly from the wallet for yield farming or staking.
